        <h2>Aims</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
        <p>
            Since the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, UK labour productivity has lagged behind a number of other developed economies, 
            and crucially has grown at a significantly lower rate than the pre-2008 trend. This project aims to explore the extent of
            this so called 'Productivity Puzzle', and examine the potential causes of this fall in productivity growth. I will examine data 
            from across the world on productivity, investment and industrial policy, and demonstrate that the UK is facing structural issues 
            that underpin our dissapointing labour productivity.

            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p> 
                The chart below uses data from the ONS. I have cleaned the data and used sklearn to conduct a linear regression on data from before 2008. 
                The UK has clearly decoupled from its previous trend of steady
                productivity growth. </p>

        <h2>European Productivity</h2>
        <p> 
            It is important to consider how productivity has developed in other countries to see if the UK really is an outlier. 
            The data seems to suggest we are not alone. Other strong European economies such as Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium have also faced low growth. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The chart takes data 
            from the ONS and Eurostat on GDP per hour worked. I have re-indexed the data to 1995 as the base year so that the recent development in productivity 
            is clear. 
            <br>

    <p>The next chart takes data from the World Bank on output per worker. This shows actual values rather than indexes. I have calculated the 'shortfall' in British productivity, shown in the lower section of the visualisation. 
        This is the percentage difference in productivity between each country and the UK. 
        It is immediately evident that the UK has been lagging behind other major economies since the 90's.

            <h2>Global Investment</h2>
            <p> 
                Capital investment is a key contributor to labour productivity; in general we would expect a greater capital to labour ratio 
                to correspond to higher productivity.
                <br>
                <br>
                The chart below takes data 
                from the world bank on gross fixed capital formation. I used a batch downloader to access data for each country and combine them to 
                one dataframe. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The data is quoted as percentage of GDP, this allows for comparison between countries and gives an indication of the capital-output 
                ratio across countries. From the data we can see that the UK has had consistently lower capital formation than many other developed 
                economies. Countries such as the US, France and Germany generally have capital formation of 20% or above, whereas the UK has seen 
                rates as low as 15%, as in 2012.

        <h2>Why does this matter?</h2>
        <p> 
            The link between investment and productivity has not always been strong. There are many other factors that impact productivity such as R&D spending, or exogenous shocks. In the chart below I have conducted 
            seperate regressions on 4 different periods, in an attempt to control some of these exogenous factors. What is evident is a strong correlation between capital investment and productivity since 2008. This chart 
            also uses World Bank data on the 10 largest European economies. I have used sklearn to conduct linear regressions; the graph is also interactive: scroll to zoom in on individual graphs.

        <h2>Industry Analysis</h2>
        <p> 
            Another potential cause of low productivity is a shift from high to low productivity sectors. I have taken data from the ONS on employment levels and productivity by sector. 
            I have calculated some additional metrics on <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1aXWw3_5YEs36iKgpr9HIu1o-U1iVfD_P?usp=sharing">python</a> to allow for better analysis. Specifically, 
            relative productivity refers to how productive a sector is compared with the national average (i.e a value of 1). The data highlights a significant shift away from manufacturing and wholesale trade, which have
            remained as the most productive sectors since 2007.

    <h2>Data</h2>
    <p>
        The data in this project has been obtained from the ONS, Eurostat, the OECD and the World Bank. The majority of datasets were accessed via APIs. 
        A few datasets, specifically productivity data from the ONS is only available as an excel, in this case I have still used python to directl access 
        the excel file on the ONS webpage to ensure automation in my data cleaning. All data was first cleaned in Python using pandas, before being exported as JSON 
        files for use in vega-lite. Links to my colab files are here:

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>
            Finding data has been relatively easy due to the nature of my project: macroeconomic indicators are freely published by national and global bodies such 
            as the ONS, Eurostat and the World Bank. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I faced some difficulties cleaning and utilising the ONS industry productivity data. The data was taken from excel files, which warrants a basic level of cleaning, 
            however there was more significant difficulty when merging datasets as the labelling and formatting of different British industries varies across datasets. 
            My solution was to label all the industries with SIC 2007 codes using a python dictionary; some rows had to be summed due to groupings of different industries, however 
            I successfully managed to merge my required datasets using industry codes so that I could compare employment levels and productivity.
            <br>
            <br>
            Throughout the project I have made extensive use of interactivity to ensure I can display all the necessary data. Interactive visuals 
            have allowed for comparisons between countries and across time periods with multiple variables, to ensure the full picture can be understood.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
    <div>
        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        <p>
            The data shows that the UK is facing a significant issue with labour productivity. Low business investment and a shift in industry towards lower 
            productivity service sectors is holding the UK back from maintaining pace with other developed economies. Additionally, British spending on research and development is lower than
            many other major economies, likely hindering it from achieving the same level of productivity.
            <br>
            <br>
            The 'Productivity Puzzle' is an enormous issue, and there is far more data that could be analysed to try and examine its causes. In particular, 
            there is a need to examine British investment into upskilling workers, either through 
            formal education, aprenticeships or retraining programs, to better understand how we can invest in human capital.
