        <h1>Why has UK labour productivity stagnated since the Global Financial Crisis?</h2>
        <p>
            Since the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, UK labour producivity has lagged behind a number of other developed economies, 
            and crucially has grown at a significantly lower rate than the pre-2008 trend. This project aims to explore the extent of
            this so called 'Productivity Puzzle', and examine the potential causes of this fall in productivity growth.

            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p> 
                The chart below uses data from the ONS. Unfortunately ONS productivity data is not available from an API; I have used 
                python to access the excel file containing productivity data. I have cleaned the data and used sklearn to conduct a linear 
                regression on data from before 2008. This gives a linear trend from before the Global Financial Crisis. Overlaying the fitted 
                line on top of the actual data shows a clear decoupling of output per hour from the pre-2008 trend rate. The python notebook 
                can be accessed <a href = 'https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13CGdRzVevfxGeoKnH8LeQpfculZgPxQi?usp=sharing'>here.</a>

                                                                                                                    // You should have a spec for a graph in this same folder. Just specify its name here, e.g. let figure_1_spec = "chart1.json"

        <h2>European Productivity</h2>
        <p> 
            It is important to consider how productivity has developed in other countries to see if the UK really is an outlier. The chart below takes data 
            from the ONS and Eurostat on GDP per hour worked. I have re-indexed the data to 1995 as the base year so that the recent development in productivity 
            is clear. The python notebook can be accessed <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wVbbUO-ASqrrXhN8u_yLuMgNdUMMnbx4?usp=sharing">here</a> 
            The graph is interactive: filter for countries by clicking on legend elements, or the lines themselves; drag across the lower chart to select 
            the time frame. The data seems to suggest we are not alone. Other countries have also faced low growth. However be aware this is a chart showing growth 
            from an index year. It does not show the true difference in labour productivity between countries.

            <h2>Global Investment</h2>
            <p> 
                Capital investment is a key contributor to labour productivity; in general we would expect a greater capital to labour ratio 
                to correspond to higher productivity as workers have a greater level of real capital to work with. The chart below takes data 
                from the world bank on gross fixed capital formation. I used a batch downloader to access data for each country and combine them to 
                one dataframe. The python notebook can be accessed <a href='https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1djLi3YQz_z7Cr9CKQicytmGsh31pW3cY?usp=sharing'>here.</a> 
                The data is quoted as percentage of GDP, this allows for comparison between countries and gives an indication of the capital-output 
                ratio across countries. From the data we can see that the UK has had consistently lower capital formation than many other developed 
                economies. Countries such as the US, France and Germany generally have capital formation of 20% or above, whereas the UK has seen 
                rates as low as 15% in 2012.
